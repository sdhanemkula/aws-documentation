# S3

## General
* Use consistent bucket naming standards when naming buckets (my_company-account_num-aws_region-env-product-application-etc)

| bucket name | Comments |
| -- | -- |
|acme-XXXXXXXXX-us-east-1-dev-product-raw|RAW bucket for product data in DEV account|
|acme-XXXXXXXXX-us-east-1-prd-product-udl|UDL bucket for product data in PRD account|


## Security
* Encrypt all data at the BUCKET LEVEL using AES-256

* **ALL BUCKETS SHOULD NEVER BE PUBLIC!** Use bucket "Block public access" settings [more info here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-block-public-access-another-layer-of-protection-for-your-accounts-and-buckets/)


## Costs
* Make sure to understand overall costs when selecting a storage class for S3 data (e.g. Standard vs. intelligent tiering vs. infrequent access)

* Only consider using intelligent tiering with large infrequently used data sizes (e.g. TB sized data). Additionally ensure to consider the monitoring charge per 1K objects in overall costs!
