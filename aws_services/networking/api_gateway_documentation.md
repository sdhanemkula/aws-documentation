# API Gateway Documentation
This page summarizes information on API Gateway Service documentation.

## General
* The management console does NOT automatically delete the documentation parts associated to a resource/method/parameter/etc. As a result if you create a method and add documentation then delete the method the docs still exist. They can be manually removed using the CLI if required.
* The documentation exported is all documentation parts associated at the time creating the deployment.
