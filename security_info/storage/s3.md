# S3

This page documents security considerations when using S3.

# General Guidance/Information
Amazon S3 can possess serious security threats due to ability to make buckets 'public' exposed.

As a result we have blocked all access from developers being able to create S3 buckets.


# Policy
* All S3 buckets must be non-public (exceptions handled by ETS)
* Developers do NOT have permissions to create S3 buckets. ALL S3 buckets will be created by ETS team!
* Buckets will ensure to Encrypt all data at the BUCKET LEVEL using AES-256
* Utilize "Block public access" settings [more info here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-block-public-access-another-layer-of-protection-for-your-accounts-and-buckets/)
* Any cross account bucket access will be maintained by an OPS team and NOT controlled by development teams. These require specific bucket policy definitions to enable access at the account level
* Cross account bucket policies will restrict access to only 'read' from non bucket owner account. For example, if business account needs access to IT created bucket it will be restricted to read only.

**Open Items**
* S3 Bucket Lifecycle Configuration
* Secure Transport
* Secure Access Logging

**ETS bucket Examples**

**Bucket with public access blocked**
```yaml
  BucketAwsAthenaQueryResults:
    Properties:
      AccessControl: Private
      BucketEncryption:
        ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration:
        - ServerSideEncryptionByDefault:
            SSEAlgorithm: AES256
      BucketName:
        Fn::Sub: aws-athena-query-results-${AWS::AccountId}-${AWS::Region}
      PublicAccessBlockConfiguration:
        BlockPublicAcls: true                   <-- blocking public access>
        BlockPublicPolicy: true                 <-- blocking public access>
        IgnorePublicAcls: true                  <-- blocking public access>
        RestrictPublicBuckets: true             <-- blocking public access>
```

**Bucket permitting cross account access**
```yaml
  BucketproductRaw:
    Properties:
      AccessControl: Private
      #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_54:Handled by role
      BucketEncryption:
        ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration:
        - ServerSideEncryptionByDefault:
            SSEAlgorithm: AES256
      BucketName:
        Fn::Sub: ${AWS::AccountId}-${AWS::Region}-${AppEnv}-product-raw
      PublicAccessBlockConfiguration:
        BlockPublicAcls: true
        BlockPublicPolicy: false            <-- false permits specific policy to enable cross accounts>
        IgnorePublicAcls: true
        RestrictPublicBuckets: true
```

**Bucket policy for cross account**
```yaml
  BucketPolicyproductRaw:
    Properties:
      Bucket:
        Ref: BucketproductRaw
      PolicyDocument:
        Statement:
        - Action:
          - s3:GetBucketAcl         <!-- limited read only access to business account>
          - s3:GetObject
          - s3:GetObjectAcl
          - s3:GetObjectVersion
          - s3:ListBucket
          Effect: Allow
          Principal:
            AWS: arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXX:root             <!-- account specific only>
          Resource:
          # limited scope of permission to only specific buckets
          - Fn::Sub: arn:aws:s3:::${AWS::AccountId}-${AWS::Region}-${AppEnv}-product-raw
          - Fn::Sub: arn:aws:s3:::${AWS::AccountId}-${AWS::Region}-${AppEnv}-product-raw/*
          Sid: AllowReadOnlyAccessproductBus
```
